    <div><p><strong>The amber droplet hung from the branch</strong>, 
        reaching fullness and ready to drop. 
        It waited. <span>While many of the other droplets were satisfied to form as big as 
        they could and release, this droplet had other plans.</span> It wanted to be part of 
        history. It wanted to be remembered long after all the other droplets had dissolved 
        into history. So it waited for the perfect specimen to fly by to trap and capture 
        that <em>it hoped would eventually be discovered hundreds of years in the future.</em></p></div>

    <p>Dave found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR-2TiQVY-k&ab_channel=20thCenturyStudios">joy </a> 
        in the daily routine of life. He awoke at the same time, ate the 
        same breakfast and drove the same commute. He worked at a job that never seemed 
        to change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night. It was who he had been for 
        the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change.</p>
